## I have used K-means for creation 10 of 10 clusters as per that we are classifying drivers.

## To run project follow below steps:
  #### - Clone the repository.
  #### - Import the requirements from requirements.txt file.
  #### - run app.py file
  #### - Lanuch index.html file. Try changing values and see driver classication.
